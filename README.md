Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to develop predictive models for identifying potential customer churn in the banking industry. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest and XGBoost, we aim to analyze key customer features such as age, balance, and product ownership. The objective is to provide a robust tool that enables banks to proactively address churn by identifying at-risk customers.

Synopsis:

In this data science project, we focus on predicting customer churn using advanced algorithms. The dataset encompasses critical customer attributes, including age, balance, and product ownership. Categorical variables are transformed into numerical values for effective model training. The Random Forest and XGBoost models exhibit strong predictive accuracy, surpassing industry standards. The project's significance lies in its potential to empower banks to implement targeted retention strategies, ensuring the long-term stability and growth of their customer base. The models provide actionable insights for businesses seeking to enhance customer retention and mitigate churn risks.
